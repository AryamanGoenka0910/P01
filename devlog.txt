Devlog:

12-09-2021
Recieved feedback from peers about devlog: 
  - It needs more elaboraiton on the APIs
  - It needs a breakdown of how each database is structured
  - It needs information on how our endpoints will work

The three of us worked on the design doc for about four hours. We wrote up elaboration for each of the APIs, 
drew up a site map, and also changed one of the APIs we had planned to use for another one. 

The design doc has increased from one page to six pages. We plan on working on the project this weekend.
